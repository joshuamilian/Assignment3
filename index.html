    <h3>Choice of song: </h3>
    
   <p>
The reason I choose this song was mainly because both of these artist had recently passed away last year. 
The way I stumble upon this song was one day, I was scouting through YouTube videos of Fortnite and in one of the videos this song was the intro to one of the Fortnite Video I watched.
After that I search through comments to find the name of the song.
This song made it to the Billboard on the week of October 6,2018 holding the spot #13 on the top 100.
The top words in this song were “ohoh”,”its”, “falling” and “the”.
I actually wasn’t surprised about the word “Falling” being one of the top words that was repeated during the song since the title of the song is called “Falling Down”.

    <h3>Data Structure:</h3>
 <p>
The data structure I choose for this assignment was the HashMap. 
The HashMap would store two different types of data such as a Key and a Value.
To access the Value you are looking for, the user must know the Key to retrieve its value.
The reason I choose this data structure was because it was very efficient in collecting data and easy for updating the data every time a word reappears.
If I had more time to work on the project, I would definitely focus more time on the HTML part as this was my first time learning HTML. 
The benefit of using the HashMap is that the items based on a key that can be used to retrieve the item at a later point.

    <h3>Benefits of HashMaps</h3>
    
    <p>
      
   <li>With a map it let’s you store a value on the based of a key that can be used to retrieve an item. </li>
   <li>HashMap is fail-fast iterator. Where the Iterator is an object that enables a programmer to traverse a container, particularly lists.</li>
   <li>HashMap cannot be shared between multiple threads without proper synchronization.</li>
