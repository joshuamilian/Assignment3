    <h3>Choice of song: </h3>
    
    <p>
      The data structure I chose for this assignment was the HashMap. 
      The HashMap would store two different types of data such as a key and a value. 
      To access the value, the user must know the key to retrieve its value. 
      The reason I chose this data structure was because it was very efficient in collecting data and it would easily update the data every time a word reappears. 
      If I had more time to work on the project, I would definitely focus more time on the HTML part since this was my first time learning HTML. 
      The benefit of using the HashMap is that the items are based on a key that can be used to retrieve the item at a later point.

    <h3>Data Structure:</h3>
 <p>
   The reason I chose this song was mainly because both of these artist had recently passed away last year. 
   The way I stumbled upon this song was that one day, I was browsing through YouTube for videos of Fortnite and in one of the videos this song was the introduction to the video I watched. 
   After I finished the video, I searched through the comments to find the name of the song. 
   This song made it to the Billboard on the week of October 6, 2018 holding the #13 spot on the top 100. 
   The top words in this song were “ohoh”,”its”, “falling” and “the”. 
   I actually wasn’t surprised about the word “falling” being one of the top words that was repeated during the song since the title of the song is called “Falling Down”.

<h3>Benefits of HashMaps</h3>
    
<p>
      
   <li>With a map, it lets you store a value based on a key that can be used to retrieve an item. </li>
   <br>
   <li>HashMap is fail-fast iterator. Where the Iterator is an object that enables a programmer to traverse a container, particularly lists.</li>
   <br>
   <li>HashMap cannot be shared between multiple threads without proper synchronization.</li>
